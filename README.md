# Crypto Assets Analysis with Python üêç

### This project was developed to practice data analysis applied to the cryptocurrency market, using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to explore different techniques for data collection, processing, and visualization in order to identify patterns and insights from digital assets.




#### Features
	- Collecting historical data from Yahoo Finance and Binance
	- Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, and residuals)
	- Moving averages to analyze price trends
	- Hypothesis testing:
	- Best month to invest in BTC
	- Best day to invest in BTC
	- Correlation analysis between different crypto assets
	- Candlestick chart visualizations for financial insights



#### Technologies & Libraries
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels, YFinance, Binance API.



#### üìÇ Project¬†Structure
	- crypto_analysis.ipynb    # Main notebook with the analysis
	- requirements.txt            # Project Dependencies
	- README.md                   # Project documentation



#### üìà Example Visualizations
	- Candlestick charts for BTC and other assets
	- Correlation heatmaps
	- Decomposed time series showing trend and seasonality
