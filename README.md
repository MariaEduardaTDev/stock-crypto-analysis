# Crypto Assets Analysis with Python

### This project was created to practice Data Analysis applied to the cryptocurrency market, using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and several libraries for data collection, processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.




ðŸš€ Features
	- Collecting historical data from Yahoo Finance and Binance
	- Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, and residuals)
	- Moving averages to analyze price trends
	- Hypothesis testing:
	- Best month to invest in BTC
	- Best day to invest in BTC
	- Correlation analysis between different crypto assets
	- Candlestick chart visualizations for financial insights



ðŸ›  Technologies & Libraries
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels, YFinance, Binance API.



ðŸ“‚ ProjectÂ Structure
- crypto_analysis.ipynb    # Main notebook with the analysis
- requirements.txt            # Project Dependencies
- README.md                   # Project documentation



ðŸ“Š Example Visualizations
	- Candlestick charts for BTC and other assets
	- Correlation heatmaps
	- Decomposed time series showing trend and seasonality
