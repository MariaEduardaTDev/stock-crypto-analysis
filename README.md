# Crypto Assets Analysis with Python

### This project was created to practice Data Analysis applied to the cryptocurrency market, using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and several libraries for data collection, processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.


🚀 Features
	•	📥 Collecting historical data from Yahoo Finance and Binance
	•	📈 Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, and residuals)
	•	📉 Moving averages to analyze price trends
	•	🔎 Hypothesis testing:
	•	Best month to invest in BTC
	•	Best day to invest in BTC
	•	🔗 Correlation analysis between different crypto assets
	•	🕯 Candlestick chart visualizations for financial insights


🛠 Technologies & Libraries
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels, YFinance, Binance API.
